# Waltz

**Graceful modal editing for VS Code.**

Waltz is a modal editing extension for VS Code that emphasizes smooth integration with VS Code's native features. It provides Vim-inspired keybindings while fully embracing VS Code's philosophyâ€”from multiple cursors to native selection handling.

## Inspiration & Credits

- **Based on**: [jpotterm/vscode-simple-vim](https://github.com/jpotterm/vscode-simple-vim) - The original codebase that made this project possible
- **Philosophically inspired by**: [71/dance](https://github.com/71/dance) - A Kakoune-inspired modal editor that influenced Waltz's design philosophy around selection-first editing and VS Code-native integration

Waltz aims to provide a graceful editing experience that feels natural in VS Code, like a waltz that flows smoothly with the editor's native capabilities.

## Philosophy

Unlike traditional Vim emulation that fights against VS Code's architecture, Waltz embraces it:

- **VS Code-native approach**: Works seamlessly with VS Code's selection model, cursor behavior, and editing primitives
- **Multiple cursors first-class**: Full support for VS Code's multiple cursor features instead of macros
- **Smooth integration**: Designed to complement, not replace, VS Code's built-in features
- **Modal editing without the baggage**: The power of modal editing without strict Vim compatibility constraints

## Modes

Waltz operates in four distinct modes:

| Mode | Entry | Exit |
|-|-|-|
| **Normal** | Default, press `Escape` | Enter Insert/Visual/Visual Line mode |
| **Insert** | `i`, `a`, `I`, `A`, `o`, `O` | `Escape` |
| **Visual** | `v` from Normal mode | `Escape` or mode-switching actions |
| **Visual Line** | `V` from Normal mode | `Escape` or mode-switching actions |

## Operators

Operators act on text defined by motions or text objects. Used in Normal mode by typing an operator followed by a motion/text object.

| Keys | Description | Modes |
|-|-|-|
| `d` | Delete (cuts to register) | Normal |
| `y` | Yank (copies to register) | Normal |

## Differences From Vim

Waltz prioritizes smooth integration with VS Code over strict Vim compatibility. Here are key differences:

- **No macros**: Use VS Code's multiple cursors instead. Place cursors with `Cmd+d`, `Cmd+Alt+Down`, or `Alt+Click` to edit all locations simultaneously.

- **No `.` (repeat) command**: Use multiple cursors or repeat the command instead.

- **No count prefix**: In Vim you can use counts like `3w`. In Waltz, just repeat the command or use a command that accomplishes your goal in one action.

- **Cursor can exceed line length**: In Normal mode, the cursor can go one position past the last character due to VS Code's selection model.

- **No registers**: The `d` operator copies to clipboard when deleting, so deleted text is available for pasting.

- **Different `f` and `t` motions**:
  - `t` takes one character
  - `f` takes two characters (like vim-sneak plugin)
  - `t` works like Vim's `t` in Normal mode but like `f` in Visual mode

- **No `/` (search) command**: Use the `f` motion or VS Code's native find (`Cmd+f`).

- **No jump list**: Use VS Code's native navigation with `Ctrl+-` and `Ctrl+_` instead of `Ctrl+o` and `Ctrl+i`.

- **No marks**: Use VS Code's split view with `Cmd+1` and `Cmd+2` to navigate between locations, or `Ctrl+-` to jump back.

## Settings

### Yank Highlight Color

The `y` (yank) operator temporarily highlights the yanked text to make it obvious what you're copying. Customize the highlight color:

```json
{
    "waltz.yankHighlightBackgroundColor": "#F8F3AB"
}
```

### Custom Key Bindings

Extend Waltz with custom key bindings via the `waltz.customBindings` setting:

```json
{
    "waltz.customBindings": [
        {
            "keys": ["space", "f"],
            "modes": ["normal"],
            "commands": [
                {
                    "command": "workbench.action.quickOpen"
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "keys": ["space", "w"],
            "modes": ["normal"],
            "commands": [
                {
                    "command": "workbench.action.files.save"
                },
                {
                    "command": "workbench.action.closeActiveEditor"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Custom Binding Options

- `keys` (required): Array of strings for the key sequence (e.g., `["g", "d"]`)
- `commands` (required): Array of VS Code commands to execute sequentially, each with:
  - `command` (required): The VS Code command ID
  - `args` (optional): Arguments to pass to the command
- `modes` (optional): Array of modes where binding is active (`"normal"`, `"visual"`, `"visualLine"`, `"insert"`). If omitted, applies to all modes.

Custom bindings are checked before default bindings, allowing you to override built-in mappings.

## Tips & Tricks

### Navigate with Multiple Cursors

Place cursors on multiple lines and use motions to select together:
1. Position cursor with `Cmd+d` or `Cmd+Alt+Down`
2. Use motions like `w`, `$`, etc. to navigate all cursors
3. Execute operators like `d`, `y`, `c` to edit all positions

### Combine Text Objects and Operators

- `diw` - Delete inner word
- `ci"` - Change inside double quotes
- `ya{` - Yank around braces
- `ds(` - Delete surrounding parentheses

### Using Search Motions

- `f,` then `;` - Find commas and repeat forward
- `t(` then `,` - Find before ( and repeat backward
- Great for navigating through code with known character patterns
